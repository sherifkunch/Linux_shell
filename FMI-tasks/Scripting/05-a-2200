Направете си ваш псевдоним (alias) на полезна команда.

Linux users often need to use one command over and over again.
Typing or copying the same command again and again reduces your productivity and distracts
you from what you are actually doing.

You can save yourself some time by creating aliases for your most used commands. 
Aliases are like custom shortcuts used to represent a command (or set of commands) executed with or without custom options. 
Chances are you are already using aliases on your Linux system.

You can see a list of defined aliases on your profile by simply executing alias command.
Creating aliases is relatively easy and quick process. You can create two types of aliases – temporary ones and permanent

To keep aliases between sessions, you can save them in your user’s shell configuration profile file. 
This can be: Bash – ~/.bashrc

Find a place in the file, where you want to keep the aliases. For example, you can add them in the end of the file. 
For organizations purposes you can leave a comment before your aliases something like this:

#My custom aliases
alias getAll="ps -e"
